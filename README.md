## Overview

### Purpose

The LCSLO needs a new solution to provide educational audio tours at their Nipomo property. Their previous system using the "Visit" app is now obsolete, leaving visitors without access to the audio content. The property currently has interpretive signage, but LCSLO wants to enhance visitor experience through QR-based audio narration that triggers and plays an audio file when visitors scan a QR code at a POI. The user goes around the property (Kathleenâ€™s Canyon Overlook) scanning the QR at each POI and listening to the corresponding audio.

### Team

The LCSLO team consists of {#} Cal Poly students. Over the course of about 9 months, we worked as a team to deploy this web application. The team members are listed below:
